Dental Care Project
===================

We build a simple Naive Bayes classifier for suggesting a dental patient whether he/she should have braces or not. The Naive Bayes classifier code was originally developed by Simon Lavigne-Giroux.


Data Preprocessing Steps
------------------------
 1. We first copy the data in an Excel file to a text file.
 2. We replace the white space with a comma.
 3. We add the class label to the end of each record (also use a comma to separate data).
 4. We maps the data 'Y' to 1 and 'N' to 0.
 5. We maps the class 'yes' to 1 and 'no' to 0.
 6. We fill in the missing data with the most frequent data in each class separately.
